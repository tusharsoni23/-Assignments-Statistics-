    "\n",
    "    Hashing:\n",
    "        Explanation: Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. This means that each key is hashed to determine its position in the table. The immutability of dictionary keys ensures that their hash value remains constant during their lifetime, which is essential for consistent and reliable key-based access.\n",
    "        Example: If a key were mutable and its hash value changed, it could cause inconsistencies in data retrieval. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "        python\n",
    "\n",
    "    d = {}\n",
    "    key = [1, 2, 3]  # Lists are mutable and thus cannot be dictionary keys\n",
    "    d[key] = \"value\"  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Explanation: Immutability ensures that once a key is added to the dictionary, its value and position in the hash table remain consistent. If keys were mutable, changes to the key could lead to errors or difficulties in locating the key-value pair.\n",
    "    Example: Consider a dictionary where keys are mutable and can change:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python\n",
    "\n",
