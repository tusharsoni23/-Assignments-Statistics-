    "Ans. * Python is easy to understand and readability and easy to code.\n",
    "*Python has a vast and continuously growing ecosystem of libraries. The total number of python libraries are more than. 137000 libraries  \n",
    "* Python is a open source programming language hence anybody can develop and develop and improve the language.\n",
    "*Python is a higher level programming language which means when you write code in it you don't have to worry about its architecture, memory management  or structure of code.\n",
    "*Python includes a large number of libraries that may be imported at any moment and used in a specific program . you don't have to write all the codes yourself because you'll be able to import from the existing libraries .\n",
    "*Python is the best language for machine learning. Because itâ€™s simple to understand, data validation is quick and error-free. Developers can do difficult operations without coding since they have access to a well-developed library ecosystem.\n"

    " 5.  Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
    " \n",
    "Ans  Type casting in Python refers to the conversion of one data type into another. This is useful when you need to perform operations that require a specific data type. Python provides several built-in functions for type casting, allowing you to convert data types explicitly.\n",
    "Types of Type Casting\n",
    "1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "2. Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type into another without any explicit instruction from the user. This usually happens in cases where the conversion is safe and does not result in data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:a = 10  \n",
    "b = 2.5  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding integer and float; Python converts 'a' to float automatically\n",
    "c = a + b\n",

    "print(type(c))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "print(c)  # Output: 12.5\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, Python automatically converts the integer a into a float before performing the addition, resulting in a float c.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit type casting involves manually converting one data type into another using Python's built-in functions. This is useful when you want to control the conversion process, especially when dealing with incompatible types.\n",
    "\n",
    " Common Type Casting Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "- float(): Converts a value to a float.\n",
    "- str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "- list(): Converts a value to a list.\n",
    "- tuple(): Converts a value to a tuple.\n",
    "- dict(): Converts a value to a dictionary.\n",
    "- set(): Converts a value to a set.\n",
    "\n",
    " #Example 1: String to Integer = \"123\"  # String b = int(a)  # Explicitly convert string to integer\n",

    "converted_num = int(num)\n",
    "print(type(converted_num))\n",
    "print(converted_num + 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the string \"123\" is explicitly converted to an integer using the int() function.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example 2: Float to Integer = 5.7  # Float\n",
    "b = int(a)  # Explicitly convert float to integer\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the float 5.7 is explicitly converted to an integer using the int() function, resulting in the value 5 (note that the decimal part is truncated, not rounded).\n",
    "\n",
    " Example 3: Integer to Stringa = 10  # Integer\n",
    "b = str(a)  # Explicitly convert integer to string\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "print(b)  # Output: '10'\n",
    "\n",

    "Both for and while loops can be nested within each other. This means you can have a loop inside another loop, allowing for more complex iterations.\n",

    "# Use Cases for Nested Loops:\n",
    "- Iterating over multi-dimensional data structures (e.g., a list of lists).\n",
