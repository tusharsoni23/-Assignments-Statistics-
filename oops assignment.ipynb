What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n#Ans The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n\n    #Encapsulation: This involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some components, enhancing security and reducing complexity.\n\n    #Abstraction: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the context, hiding unnecessary details. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level.\n\n    #Inheritance: This concept allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n\n    #Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overriding (same method name, different implementation in subclasses) and method overloading (same method name, different parameters).\n\n#Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific implementation of the class with its own state and behavior.\n",

Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance\n\nIn Python, inheritance allows one class (the child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or base class).

Single Inheritance\nA class inherits from one base class.\n\n\nclass Parent:\n    def show(self):\n        return \"This is the parent class.\"\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def display(self):\n        return \"This is the child class.\"\n\n\n# 2.

How does Python resolve it?\n#ans \nThe **Diamond Problem** is a common issue that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios, particularly in languages that allow a class to inherit from more than one parent class. The problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common ancestor. This creates a \"diamond\" shape in the inheritance hierarchy, which can lead to ambiguity regarding which method or attribute should be inherited from the common ancestor.\n\n\n# Python's Resolution of the Diamond Problem\n\nPython uses the **C3 Linearization** algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to resolve the Diamond Problem. This algorithm ensures a consistent and predictable method resolution order (MRO) by considering the following rules:\n\n1. The parent classes are searched in the order they are listed.\n2. The base classes are searched before their children.\n3. A class cannot be a parent of itself.\n\n\n\n#Here’s an example demonstrating the Diamond Problem in Python:\n\n\nclass A:\n    def show(self):\n        print(\"Method from A\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def show(self):\n        print(\"Method from B\")\n\nclass C(A):\n    def show(self):\n        print(\"Method from C\")\n\nclass D(B, C):\n    pass\n\n# Example usage\nd = D()\nd.show()  # Output: Method from B\n```\n\n# Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n\nYou can check the MRO of class `D` using the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute:\n\n```python\nprint(D.mro())          # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\nprint(D.__mro__)       # Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)\n```\n\n",
